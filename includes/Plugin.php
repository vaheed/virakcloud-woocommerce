         * WordPress fires the `plugins_loaded` hook before this init method
         * is called (the Plugin class is bootstrapped on that hook in the
         * main plugin file). Previously the translation loader was added
         * within another `plugins_loaded` callback which never executed
         * because the hook had already run. Consequently, translation
         * strings were not loaded and English text remained even when
         * Persian (fa_IR) or other locales were active.
         *
         * To resolve this, we call `load_plugin_textdomain` directly from
         * within the init method. The domain path parameter must point
         * to the `languages` subdirectory relative to the pluginâ€™s
         * directory name inside the WordPress plugins folder. Using
         * `basename(VCW_PATH)` yields the correct directory name even
         * when the plugin folder is versioned (e.g. `virakcloud-woo-1.0.11`).
